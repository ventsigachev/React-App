        <span className="aboutSpan">Share your story here!</span> This blog
        allows you to have a voice and be heard. You can share your story with
        the entire world if you so choose. One of the most common ways blogs are
        used are as a diary where the blogger writes about their daily
        experiences so that friends, family, and others can all be a part of
        their lives.

      <div className="about"><h3>
        <span className="aboutSpan">Find a community.</span> Blogging at its heart is interactive. You write a post
        and people read it. This is a good way to connect with people who
        are interested in the same things as you are. Blogging allows you to
        connect with these people based on your experience, and it gives you the
        opportunity to learn from your readers as well.
